Assignment 3 - Multimedia Information System
-------------------------------------------------

Please answer the following questions in written form (1-2 A4 pages max.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Task 3.2: Add a tag-based search page
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* What are the shortcomings of our very simple tagging approach?

All files are tagged by media type (image/audio/video) and file extension
Images are additionally tagged by primary color

With the exception of color tags, the tags only give us information about the kind of file, not about the content.
Probably more interesting would be more accurate color tags, and maybe also information about the content of the media.
For example: is the image of an animal, or what kind of animal.

What kind of audio file is it? An error message or music?
And also for video files: is it an ad, or a video of a panda for example.

---

* What can be said about relationships between tags?

All tags originate from the "Tags" - tag in the center, then they are split into image, audio and video groups.
File formats for video files are near the video tag and so on.
The color tags are connected with lots of files, which may make the visualization a little less clear

* We used tags for simple "content typing". How can content typing in the sense we did it improve navigation and search in an information system?

It helps categorize the content, if users only want to find audio, image or video files,
they can narrow the kinds of content that is displayed, which helps users.

Task 3.3: Metadata extraction 2
----------------------------------------------------------

* discuss the advantages and limitations of your heuristics

Our heuristics count individual pixel's most dominant color, but we ignore white,black or gray pixels.
The advantage is that our algorithm is very simple, but we are also limited in a way, because we only take the most dominant color into
consideration. Images where another color is almost as dominant, but not quite as dominant as another one would be misrepresented.
For example, yellow images might be misreprestend as red, when the red value is just 1 higher. Also, we only support the 3 primary colors red, green and blue.

* discuss the advantages and limitations of our simple dominant color model

Our Color model is limited to the primary colors red, green and blue. It also works with imagesthat are, for example, 100% yellow (RGB: 255, 255, 0) but it would display them as Red & Green
Moreover, when the image is not e.g. 100% yellow (RGB: 255, 253, 2) it would come up as Red.

An alternative approach that is used is k-means clsutering to find the dominant color in an image. (see https://charlesleifer.com/blog/using-python-and-k-means-to-find-the-dominant-colors-in-images/)
We think that this would work really well for our application, however our algorithm would no longer be that simple.

So the main advantage of our algorithm is that it is very simple, because it's just counting the pixel values in the images.
Disadvantages are the limited information we get about the images.

Task 3.4: Expose your data in GraphML
----------------------------------------------------------

* What (type of) layout algorithm do we use for the information visualization in this assignment?

The infovis uses a ForceDirectedLayout (see itm/infovis/ItmDisplay.java and http://jheer.org/publications/2004-prefuse.pdf)
Tags are layed out in a radial layout and force functions are used to simulate physics, which makes the tags "bounce around".

---

* What are advantages/disadvantages of the used infovis?

A disadvantage is that a Java applet is used, in our opinion using HTML5/CSS would be better suited to display
such information to users. It would also offer support for mobile devices which is becoming increasingly important.
